Unlike the wallet we use in everyday life, a crypto wallet works more like a series of keys, which give access to the blockchain, where the assets are stored.

One of these keys is public, and works like an account number in a traditional bank. In this sense it can be used to receive assets and also be shared with other investors.There is a shortened version of this key that is known as an address. If generated automatically, the address might look like the following code:<mark style="color:yellow;">**1bNO764gnKugF986JJfu6E708Op097.**</mark>

The user can also get the address by a QR code, generated by the Wallet tool.Another key provided to the user is the private key, with which the user can freely perform cryptocurrency transactions. Therefore, this key is very important and restricted, and should not be shared with third parties.
