# ðŸ§žâ™€ Metaverse 100x

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">What is the Metaverse?</mark>

_The metaverse is a new virtualized reality that will replace the internet as we know it. It is a concept that unites the notion of virtual simulation with practical reality to enable new functions and operations within the network._

_This technology is like a parallel virtual world, in which people will be represented by avatars. They will be able to shop, interact with people, and attend corporate meetings with virtual bodies in virtual spaces._

_Talking about this in today's world - which sees the rise of remote work and online commerce - is even easier. But discussing it 15 years ago seemed like science fiction._

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">How does the Metaverse work?</mark>

_The metaverse is based, above all, on the idea of virtual reality and augmented reality. Simulations will be crucial to generate a new, virtualized world that is managed by real people with real resources._

_In other words, access will be very similar to what people already do today, with glasses and other tools. Thus, the idea is to further increase immersion in the virtual world.In addition, the virtualized universe will also include social networks and cryptocurrencies. The focus is to generate a complete experience, with practically everything you have in real life.So naturally, people will spend even more time on the Internet and be able to solve more problems._

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">How does the Metaverse revolutionize the Internet?</mark>

_This concept will make the internet more multifunctional and creative. It will be the stage for the most diverse human activities, expanding what we have today. The idea of the metaverse creates a unique web experience that encompasses the lives of all its users. In this way, the network not only becomes a product of what users produce, but actively produces new resources and profoundly impacts people's lives._

_It is a natural continuation of what we have today. The new Internet will be even more useful in overcoming barriers, making people's lives more practical and easier, and eliminating costs. It will thus benefit the personal and professional lives of its users._
