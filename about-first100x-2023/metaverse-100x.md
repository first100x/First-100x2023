# Metaverse 100x

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">What is the Metaverse?</mark>

The metaverse is a new virtualized reality that will replace the internet as we know it. It is a concept that unites the notion of virtual simulation with practical reality to enable new functions and operations within the network.

This technology is like a parallel virtual world, in which people will be represented by avatars. They will be able to shop, interact with people, and attend corporate meetings with virtual bodies in virtual spaces.

Talking about this in today's world - which sees the rise of remote work and online commerce - is even easier. But discussing it 15 years ago seemed like science fiction.
