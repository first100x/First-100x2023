#### <mark style="color:yellow;">What is Artificial Intelligence and how does it work?</mark>

_An AI solution involves a grouping of various technologies, such as artificial neural networks, algorithms, learning systems, and others that can simulate human capabilities linked to intelligence. For example, reasoning, environmental perception, and the ability to analyze for decision making._

_We can say that the concept of AI is related to the ability of technological solutions to perform activities in a way that is considered intelligent.AIs can also "learn for themselves" thanks to learning systems that analyze large volumes of data, enabling them to extend their knowledge._

_Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also a field of science whose purpose is to study, develop, and employ machines to perform human activities autonomously.It is also linked to robotics, Machine Learning, voice and vision recognition, among other technologies._

_We will use AI protocols for face development and together with the metaverse integrate our investors into digital formats, with that we have some modules that are in development:_

_<mark style="color:yellow;">Facial Recognition Module</mark> - Having the neural network trained, the software can be applied to videos for real-time recognition of people. This module is used in the application of the ML algorithm trained in the recognition of people in real time. Different methods have been Different methods for face recognition have been developed and are being tested. In the tests performed, the methods EigenFaceRecognizer and LBPHFaceRecognizer have presented the best results._
