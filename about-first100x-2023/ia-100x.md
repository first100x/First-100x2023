#### <mark style="color:yellow;">What is Artificial Intelligence and how does it work?</mark>

An AI solution involves a grouping of various technologies, such as artificial neural networks, algorithms, learning systems, and others that can simulate human capabilities linked to intelligence. For example, reasoning, environmental perception, and the ability to analyze for decision making.

We can say that the concept of AI is related to the ability of technological solutions to perform activities in a way that is considered intelligent.

AIs can also "learn for themselves" thanks to learning systems that analyze large volumes of data, enabling them to extend their knowledge.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also a field of science whose purpose is to study, develop, and employ machines to perform human activities autonomously.

It is also linked to robotics, Machine Learning, voice and vision recognition, among other technologies.
