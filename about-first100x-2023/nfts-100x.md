#### <mark style="color:yellow;">What does NFT stand for?</mark>&#x20;

NFT stands for "non-fungible token". The term is given to a digital, blockchain-based asset that represents real objects.If we use the meaning of token as a symbol and apply the concept of fungibility (an attribute of acquired goods that can be replaced by similar ones), we can understand the NFT as a differentiated asset, containing data that makes them unique - i.e. non-fungible (not replaceable).

Different information recorded in each NFT asset makes it a different product from others, and that is why they cannot be replaced. They cannot be exchanged for equals, because no two are alike. Basically, it is how we view a work of art.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">The relationship between NFT, blockchain and cryptocurrencies</mark>

Blockchain technology is best known as synonymous with financial services, but you might be surprised to find that this almost entirely fintech universe has also paved the way for a new art industry with tokens.

The technology took its first steps with cryptocurrency being created to, among other things, prevent the double spending of real values.This is because in a digital environment, data can be copied, changed and exchanged. Blockchain was the solution to eliminate the first two characteristics. So, for example, a person cannot spend 1 Bitcoin (BTC) twice or say they sent 10 BTC, but transfer only 0.01 BTC.

<mark style="color:yellow;">But, who checks this?</mark>

Well, blockchain technology can be explained as a public ledger (an accounting book) that keeps track of currency transactions. Since blockchain is a network that works with blocks that always carry a fingerprint, the next block will also contain the fingerprint of the previous one, plus its own content and, with these two pieces of information, generate its own fingerprint; verifiable by all.The application of NFT in art takes the use of blockchain far beyond the ordinary. The list of possible uses of the technology is practically endless, also relating to other cryptocurrencies and the metaverse, recently announced by Meta, formerly Facebook.
